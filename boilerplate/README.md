This is a boilerplate for Js web development projects
You can add this to any project you are working on

The steps are:
1) copy paste the boiler contents into your project folder
2) In the terminal, run this command to install the packages listed in the package.json file "npm install"
3) To start the web server, run "npm run serve"
4) For final step before production, run "npm run build"

For all commands for terminal, check the pacakge.json scripts area

Happy Coding!!!!
